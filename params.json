{"name":"FasterLootPlus","tagline":"Advanced MasterLoot replacement and auto-assignment addon for Wildstar","body":"### What is FasterLootPlus?\r\nFasterLootPlus is a Addon for Wildstar more than a year in the making that replaces Carbine's MasterLoot window and allows the Raid Leader to set up rules and rule sets that to control the automatic assignment of loot.  \r\n\r\n### What features does FasterLootPlus provide? \r\n* A redesigned MasterLoot panel for both the raid leader and raid members which takes up far less screen real estate.\r\n* A MasterLoot deferral button which delays the opening of the MasterLoot until it is clicked, preventing the window from popping up during combat.\r\n* A Random Assign option to randomly assign loot to a random eligible looter.\r\n* A Roll-Off option to allow players to /roll for an item. This tracks all rolls and automatically assigns to the winning roller and reports if there is a tie.\r\n* A comprehensive loot rule editor, so that rules can be setup to allow certain loot or certain kinds of loot to be automatically distributed randomly or to specific raid members.\r\n\r\n### Why this addon?\r\nThe default MasterLoot interface is very large and intrusive to game play. It is also poorly optimized and does not present information to the users in a useful way and often has problems with other addons breaking the tooltips. MasterLooting many common drops is also very tedious and interferes with the raid leader's ability to play the game.  FasterLootPlus solves those problems by presenting a better interface and allows the Raid Leader to decide ahead of time how some loot should be distributed.\r\n\r\nFor example: Many guilds commonly bank Rune Focus drops. FasterLootPlus allows you to set up a rule that lets you provide a list of  looters that it can be automatically assigned to. In fact, it comes with a set of default rules that requires minimal setup to do that out-of-the-box.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with FasterLootPlus?
